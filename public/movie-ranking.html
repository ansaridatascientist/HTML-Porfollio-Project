<h1>The Best Movies According to Ali Ansari</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mission Impossible</h3>
<p>One of my favourite action films ever, i just finished watching this for the first time in about 20 years. Full of action, suspense and great stunts, Tom Cruise plays young spy Ethan Hunt on the run after a failed mission where it sees his team killed off after a suspicious set up.</p>
<h3>James Bond 007</h3>
<p>The best Bond in decades! <br />
    This is the James Bond that we have all been waiting for!!!!! <br />
    This is by far one of the best James Bond films of all time!!! <br />
    Daniel Craig makes his debut here and he is absolutely terrific! <br />
    This is the first time that I actually really cared about the character of Bond!.
</p>
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>John wick stands out in a crowd of overdone ,uninspired and boring action adventure films, John wick shouldn't of been as good as it is but with some great acting and fun world building John wick makes for a fantastic movie. My main issue with most movies similar to John wick are that most of the fight scenes have to many cuts so you can barely see what's going on. John wick doesn't have this issue in any of its action scenes. </p>
